Hi. My name is Sif Sigmarsdóttir. I’m a writer and a journalist. I live in London with my two children, Inspiration-Drain-One and Inspiration-Drain-Two, my husband who goes by the name He-Who-Takes-Out-The-Trash and a family of moths that are unfortunately not the only reason I can’t buy myself a proper cashmere sweater.
</p>
<p>
I’ve been writing children’s books in Icelandic for over ten years. I am Traitor is my debut novel in the English language. If you want to support my dream of owning a cashmere sweater — and a house without moths where one can actually hang a cashmere sweater without it being eaten up — you can <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01MA31HWG/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1">buy my book from Amazon</a>.
</p>
<p>

I have a BA in history from the University of Iceland, and an MA in children’s literature from the University of Reading. I write a column for the Icelandic newspaper Fréttablaðið. My most recent book in Icelandic, Freya's Saga, was nominated for the Icelandic Literary Prize.

I also write a <a href="http://www.medium.com/sifs-journal">blog</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/sifsigmars">tweet</a> and share a filtered version of my life on <a href="http://www.instagram.com/sif.sigmarsdottir">Instagram</a>.
