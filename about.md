    Hi. My name is Sif Sigmarsdóttir. I’m a writer and a journalist. I live in London with my two children, Inspiration-Drain-One and Inspiration-Drain-Two, my husband who goes by the name He-Who-Takes-Out-The-Trash and a family of moths that are unfortunately not the only reason I can’t buy myself a proper cashmere sweater.
    </p>

    I was born in the apparent feminist utopia that is Iceland (we top a lot of lists), but still thought there was a gender imbalance in the publishing industry. So, I founded a publishing company to address that imbalance. <a href="https://www.thebookseller.com/insight/song-iceland-fire-766751">I wrote about the experience in the Bookseller recently</a>.
    </p>
    <p>I read history at the University of Iceland and have an MA in children's literature from the University of Reading. My books are inspired by history, which I still sometimes research and write about. Most recently I wrote about <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/long_reads/iceland-history-annie-leifs-life-death-women-a8854556.html">Annie Leifs, the woman who disappeared from history</a>, in the Independent.

    I’ve been writing children’s books in Icelandic for over ten years and was very proud to be nominated for the Icelandic Literary prize for one of them. I write a weekly column for the Icelandic newspaper Fréttablaðið and sometimes express my views in English as well, most recently about equal pay in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/05/iceland-female-women-equal-pay-gender-equality">the Guardian</a>.

    The Sharp Edge of a Snowflake is my second book in the English language. If you want to support my dream of owning a cashmere sweater — and a house without moths where one can actually hang a cashmere sweater without it being eaten up — you can <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sharp-Edge-Snowflake-Sif-Sigmarsdottir/dp/1444935305">buy my book from Amazon</a>.

     I <a href="http://www.twitter.com/sifsigmars">tweet</a> (not much), hang out on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sif.sigmarsdottir.official">Facebook</a> (too much) and share a filtered version of my life on <a href="http://www.instagram.com/sif.sigmarsdottir">Instagram</a>.
