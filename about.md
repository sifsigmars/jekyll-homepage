    Hi. My name is Sif Sigmarsdóttir. I’m a writer and a journalist. I live in London with my two children, Inspiration-Drain-One and Inspiration-Drain-Two, my husband who goes by the name He-Who-Takes-Out-The-Trash and a family of moths that are unfortunately not the only reason I can’t buy myself a proper cashmere sweater.

    I’ve been writing children’s books in Icelandic for over ten years. The Sharp Edge of a Snowflake is my second book in the English language. If you want to support my dream of owning a cashmere sweater — and a house without moths where one can actually hang a cashmere sweater without it being eaten up — you can <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sharp-Edge-Snowflake-Sif-Sigmarsdottir/dp/1444935305">buy my book from Amazon</a>.

    I have a BA in history from the University of Iceland, and an MA in children’s literature from the University of Reading. I write <a href="">a column</a> for the Icelandic newspaper Fréttablaðið. My most recent book in Icelandic, Freya's Saga, was nominated for the Icelandic Literary Prize.

    I've also written for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/05/iceland-female-women-equal-pay-gender-equality">the Guardian</a>, the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/long_reads/iceland-history-annie-leifs-life-death-women-a8854556.html">Independent</a> and other publications, I <a href="http://www.twitter.com/sifsigmars">tweet</a> and share a filtered version of my life on <a href="http://www.instagram.com/sif.sigmarsdottir">Instagram</a>.
