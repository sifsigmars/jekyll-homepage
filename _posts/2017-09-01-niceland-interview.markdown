It was a great pleasure to chat with York Underwood from Niceland who are doing interviews in English with various Icelandic creatives.

The interview is called "trúnó" which is an Icelandic concept which roughly translates to "a private conversation very late at night".

If you want to read about the advice on becoming an author I would give to a younger me ("Don't do it! Run for your life!") and why I wouldn't have listened, you can read it here: <a href="http://www.thisisniceland.com/truno-sif-sigmarsdottir/">What they do and how they do it: Sif Sigmarsdóttir</a>.
